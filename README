These are my answers to exercises in Graham Hutton's amazing book `Programming
in Haskell`. I will keep adding these as I progress in the book. Some of the
examples in the chapters are covered as well. This repository is mostly for
personal use but maybe it helps someone out who is also reading the book. :)
